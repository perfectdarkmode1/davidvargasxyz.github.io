This is a page to help me stay focused and keep track of what I am doing. It is also to show others what I am currently working on and thinking about. Credit goes to Derrick Sivers for starting a "Now" page movement. Read about "Now" pages [here](https://nownownow.com/about).

## Career

I am currently a Network Engineer and considering a career change into writing. I have become slightly aversive to tech over the years so it seems like this career is not a great fit for me.

## Mental Health

I have been dealing with a moderate caffeine addiction that has been effecting my sleep pretty badly. I haven't found the grit needed to quit completely so I am focusing on other aspects of my life. 

I haven't had any alcohol for months. Currently on a 90 day celibacy/semen retention experiment and meditating daily. 

## What I am Reading

Autobiography of a Yogi. 

## Music

Currently building a powerful minimalist electronic drum set. Will post some pictures when finished. 

## What I am thinking about

Currently considering my career options. May swap out the site name to a pen name and build a Freelance content writing business based on personal development.
