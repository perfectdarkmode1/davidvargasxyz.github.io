Anyone got tips for increasing T naturally? How can I objectively document this for others?

I have consistently test low on T for years now. Numbers average around 350 ng/dl, very low E2, lowish DHEA, FSH, and LH, normal Thyroid, and normal blood lipids. I am unmotivated, have poor sleep, don't exercise, sit at a desk all day, abuse stimulants to get me through the day, and eat junk. I am also slightly overweight, around 25% bodyfat. (195.6lbs currently)

I would like to lay out a plan to keep me accountable to try and raise my T levels naturally. I would also like to get bloodwork and lay everything out online. So that if I am successful, others may follow (or not) my path.

I would like some help creating this plan, knowing what would be helpful to document, and what bloodwork to get done and how often.

Current plan:

1.  Get bloodwork done at the beginning, and every 3 months?
    
    1.  vitamin d, testosterone, blood lipids, E2, FSH, LH, SHGB, Thyroid, Prolactin, DHEA, Cortisol?
2.  Start lifting weights 3-4 days per week and going on a jog each morning.
    
3.  Start tracking my diet on cronometer to make sure I meet my nutritional needs
    
4.  Stay in a calorie deficit to lose 30lbs. (would before and after pictures help?)
    
5.  Take any supplements like vitamin d if I am deficient.
    

Anything else I should add to my plan? If this doesn't work then I will consider TRT. WOuld anyone be interested in following this journey? What other bloodword should I get done?
