A succubus has visited you in your sleep. It has come to test your purity. You have been true on the path in your waking state. But the dream state has never been tested.

The next morning arrives. You realized what has happened. I dreamed about a women that could disguise herself has a piece of corn. She has been silently watching, and waiting to make her move.

She sabotages your life, so you turn to her, you penetrate her and it is all over.

You gather your bearings. The chaser effect is true, you will feel most potent and vigorous today. You must meditate. Get yourself rooted so the wave of lustful thoughts cannot tempt you in your waking state.

## It was all an illusion.

Perhaps you were tempted the previous day. Or you were scrolling social media and the slot machines weren’t favorable. They fed you a dream. The pull was too strong.

You need to step away from anything with the pull. Great monks and sages would recommend you remove your presence from all women.

You at least need to get off of the slot machines. Do not hang out where you will be tempted. Why fight against armies of scientists that want to keep you hooked?

## You weren’t creating enough.

Your sexual energy is the most creative force on the planet. If you do not use it to create, then it will force its way out. You are reading too many books, watching too much television, or scrolling the internet.

This journey is time to write, time to play and practice your instrument, time to draw. Bring life into this world.

If you do not create then your body will have no choice but to invite the succubus.
