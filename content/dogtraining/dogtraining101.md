For years, famous dog trainers like Cesar Milan would teach people to train dogs with aversive tactics and “Dominance”. It turns out these methods are just plain cruel and make things much worse for your dog.

So much so that even police forces have banned the use of aversive training to get highly trained killer attack dogs.

Dogs lack the contextual ability to understand what punishments are. They will usually just make your doggo scared of you.

Aversive tactics will only change their behavior in the exact situation that they are in when they are punished. And cause a host of other problems along the way.

As soon as you leave the room, they think they are free to do the behavior again. And besides, do you really want your dog to be miserable?

Also, Dogs (like humans), will also endure punishment if they think a reward is worth it. So these methods are not as effective as we are led to believe.

## The New Way: Progressive Reinforcement
Rewarding dogs for good behavior will reinforce that behavior. Ignoring or preventing bad behavior will stop bad behaviors from happening.

Read that again...

## Treats, Toys, and Cuddles
There are three main rewards used to reinforce your dog's behavior. Treats, toys, and belly rubs (attention).

When “shaping” a new behavior, treats tend to be the most effective. All dogs will do anything to get a treat. And they are damn smart at figuring out how to get them. There are three types of treats to give your dog:

- High Value
- Medium Value
- Low Value

High-value treats are the cream of the crop. When you need something that is more rewarding than the ever-so-rewarding environment your dog is in. This is your go-to.

Think of all of the smells, bugs, and dogs at your local park. You need a reward that is better than what they could get if they simply ignored you.

Try stuff like cheese, beef liver, and bacon (to be used sparingly).

Medium-value rewards are used for medium-value environments. Think backyard with some distractions. These are things like training treats that you can find at the pet store.

Low-value rewards are used in the house with minimal distraction. Many people just use their dog's kibble for a low-value reward.

This is a great way to have your dog work for their meal rather than just dumping it in a big bowl.

If a certain treat is not working for your dog, they simply do not find it rewarding enough. Searching out and getting food is engrained in your dog’s DNA. And is a skill that they have been honing for (perhaps) millions of years.

It’s up to you to find out what treats makes your dog tick.

## Marking Good Behaviors
You’ve probably seen those small devices that make a “click”. You know they are for dogs. But how do they work?

A clicker is what dog trainers call a “Reward Marker”. This is Pavlov’s bell. They hear a sharp “click”, and they get a reward.

Dogs will repeatedly do what gets them a “click”. The good thing is, they will often exaggerate the movement or position that has gotten them a “click” in the past.

We can use this to our advantage.

## Exercise: Charging the Clicker
Here is how you get your dog to associate a clicker with a reward. If you do not have a clicker, you can use a verbal reward marker like a friendly “yes” or “good”.

However, clickers are more precise and highly recommended. For these instructions, replace the “click” with your verbal marker of choice.

Step 1: Hold the clicker behind your back. We start here because some dogs are scared of the clicker noise at first. So we want to muffle the sound.

“Click” and give your dog a treat. Do this a few times.

Step 2: After your dog is used to the clicking sound and you are sure they are scared, bring it out in front of you. “Click” and give a treat. Do this 5–10 times.

Step 3: Start walking around the living room. Keep clicking and immediately giving treats. After 20–30 treats. Your dog should be primed for clicker training.

## Shaping Behaviors
Let’s teach your dog how to sit. What do you do? Instead of pushing Fido’s rear end to the ground and saying “Sit”. Start in your living room, and follow this process.

1. Use a treat as a lure. Let them get into the desired position themselves. Mark and reward small movements that trend toward the desired result.
2. Once you get the desired behavior reliably. Add a verbal queue. And fade the Lure.
3. Generalize the behavior by adding distractions.

## Luring the Sit
Take a nummy and put it over and back behind your dog's head. Your dog’s body will eventually make a movement that is trending in the right direction.

Look for a subtle knee bend (if they don’t just sit right away). “Click” and reward any movement where their fuzzy butt goes toward the ground.

If you “click” Progressively towards a sit, eventually you will get a sit.

## Adding a Verbal Queue
Only after you are getting the behavior reliably, do you add the word “Sit”. Here, you will say “sit”, then Lure the behavior. Do this repeatedly. Then, you will start to “fade the lure”.

Lure “fading” is a technique dog trainers use to get rid of a lure over time. This lets a pooch better associate a verbal queue with what you want them to do.

To fade a lure, simply cut back on the use of your treat and hand motion over time. First, say the command “sit” and do the same hand motion that got the “sit” but without the treat.

Then, say “sit” and lessen the hand motion until you can get the sit with just the verbal command.

## Generalizing Behaviors
You will notice that your dog will only want to do a trick when they are in the living room, with no distractions around. As soon as they get outside, or you try to show a friend…

They become wild animals…

This is where generalization comes in. Generalization is a way to get a dog to do a behavior in any situation. You do this by adding gradual distractions.

Have your dog perform sit following a path that adds more and more distraction. If you slip up, take a step back to a less distracting step.

The general steps to adding distractions are as follows.

1. Living room (no distractions)
2. Backyard (slight distractions)
3. Out on a walk (more distractions)
4. At a park (intense distractions)
5. Outside of a dog park (impossible)
6. Inside a dog park (nuclear)

Each of these steps provides new challenges for your dog to stay focused. Birds, people, other dogs, traffic, etc. The ultimate training ground.

Soon your dog will sit in any situation. Give your dog a chance to succeed by always starting at the bottom of the list.

Get creative, this ladder is not all-inclusive.

## Adding Other Tricks and Modifying Behaviors
The steps above lay the foundation for Progressive Reinforcement training. You will use them to get your dogs to do impressive feats. Use the principles above to teach your dogs some useful tricks:

- Leave it
- Down
- Loose leash walking
- Stay
- Fetch
- Come

Remember, never get mad at your dog or yell at them. Stay positive and train behaviors that you want, rather than focusing on getting your dog to stop doing something.

You can use these steps for behavior modification as well. All kinds of problems can be solved by using progressive reinforcement training:

- Fear
- Chasing
- Aggressiveness
- Unwanted Chewing
- Unwanted Barking
